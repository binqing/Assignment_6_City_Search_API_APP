The Zip and City search API (ctp-zip-api)
http://ctp-zip-api.herokuapp.com/

For this project we will be developing two simple applications, (1) the first app allows us to search for City names and details for a given zip code, and (2) the second app allows us to find all of Zip codes associated with a given City name.

Below is a description of the relevant API endpoints for the projects:

/city/:cityname - find Zip Codes associated with a city name
http://ctp-zip-api.herokuapp.com/city/:cityname

:cityname must be in all caps

provide the city name in the url and you will receive a JSON response with an array containing a list of all zip codes for that city:

http://ctp-zip-api.herokuapp.com/city/SPRINGFIELD


Project 2: City Search app
In this project we will allow the user to provide us a City name and we will display all of the associated zip codes to the user.

To get started run the following commands

create-react-app city-search
cd city-search
npm start
At this point you should see the React hello world page running on your browser. You should leave it running in the background while you work on this project.

Now open this folder (city-search) in your text editor. You will see all of the code the create-react-app setup for us. Since this is the stock project we can begin editing the files as we see fit. You can start at App.js and you can also edit public/index.html (to add Bootstrap for example).

Using the same API as project 1, we will build a City search app, where given a city name, we will display all returned zip codes.

Primary Tasks
Using the same ctp-zip-api we used in project 1:

Implement a City Search field that takes city names
it should allow city names to be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case letters
Display all zip codes received from the API

Stretch Features (Optional, but highly recommended)
Display all states where the city was found in the API
Group received zip codes by state
Display city details for each Zip code
Note: these will require additional fetch call to the API. Feel free to use your own CSS styles and to add any additional features you want.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
